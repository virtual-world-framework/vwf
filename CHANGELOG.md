Note: (*) indicates an API change.

- NEW: Apple Macintosh OSX installation script and README.md updated. Fixes #1903
- CHG: Added source url name to help someone understand where the script is attached to
- CHG: Removed the test/planeMaterial application, test/nodeMaterial is working and does the same thing
- CHG: Removed material being used as a property( it's a child/component), and fixed test/nodeMaterial
- CHG: Fixed copy paste error dealing with getting the camera's world position
- CHG: Remove duplicate code from persistence by passing in an extension parameter. Refs #1810.
- CHG: Update persistence functionality to save current running state into a configuration file, including browser title, model and view drivers and as well as associated parameters. Fixes #1810.

- CHG: Reduce the camera rotation rate to make the scene easier to navigate.
- CHG: Increase navigation updates from 10 to 30 fps. This is the maximum update rate. Time increments are still controlled by the server which currently defaults to 20 fps. Change the value in `schedule_tick` in `vwf/application/reflector.rb` to adjust.
- CHG: Add support for using animations from the collada model in threejs.js Refs #1867, #1953
- CHG: Split out Rakefile task for a new web task, updates the default to build a full build, and removes the web from the rake build command.

- CHG: Replace deprecated THREE.UV with THREE.Vector2 refs #1871
- CHG: Fix parameter to renderer.setFaceCulling We had been passing "false" when it expected an enumerated value that specified the culling mode - the result was that it was culling both front and back faces ... which for obvious reasons was undesirable fixes #1870
- CHG: Add negative scale fixes to new three.js and remove deprecated calls refs #1683, 1870, 1871
- CHG: Initial commit of three.js r57 refs #1683

- CHG: Update radio components from radio and radio-lesson application to match. Fix bug in lesson view driver for allowing applications not named index. Refs #1886.
- CHG: Prevent the jsdoc filter from generating a comment closing its own block. `/////...` was being converted to '/**//...' and causing a syntax error. Now, any `*/` sequence in the resulting comment is converted to `* /`. Also, only comment lines starting with exactly three slashes are considered to be jsdoc comments. For ruby-style comments in YAML files, jsdoc blocks must start with exactly two hash characters. Closes #1874, #1884.
PhantomJS integration of gem into baseline refs #1595
- NEW: Add 2D tile puzzle app. Fixes #207
- CHG: Fix config files to handle drivers it doesn't know about without failing. Refs #1850

----------------------------------
0.6.7
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: (*) indicates an API change.

- CHG: Fix typos in lesson for GameTech Demonstration of Virtual World Framework.
- CHG: Remove old work-around for orientation problems. Not needed after the orientation fixes, plus it was making a direct kernel reference and using an invalid static ID. References #1680.
- CHG: Revert terrain z position and camera far changes from commit:6576d61. Raising the terrain would allow the camera to rotate to see underneath it. The distance to the far end of the terrain with the default orbit radius is approximatly 40000. The previous far value of 500000 should still be OK. References #1680.
- CHG: changed implements: //vwf.example.com/control.vwf to 'control-old.vwf' to account for threejs merge
- CHG: Explicity disable specular highlights in the humvee applications.
- CHG: Humvee lesson updates: Rename cameraPoses to more meaningful names.
- CHG: Humvee lesson updates: Added simple drive capability attached to 'G' key.
- CHG: Humvee lesson updates: Pass the key events down to the humvee
- CHG: Humvee lesson updates: Added the ability for the user to take control of the humvee
- CHG: Humvee lesson updates: Made some functions local due to issues calling those functions within the behavior
- CHG: Humvee lesson updates: Added resetting the humvee mode when entering the lesson
- CHG: Humvee lesson updates: Added support to remember the last active camera
- CHG: Humvee lesson updates: Merge branch 'branch/threejs' of http://github.com/virtual-world-framework/vwf into branch/threejs
- CHG: Humvee lesson updates: Remove empty `value:` fields from components.
- CHG: Humvee lesson updates: Rather than not setting a value, these were actually setting a value of `null`.
- CHG: Humvee lesson updates: Don't presume the application ID in the driver `initialize`.
- CHG: Apply the `this.scene.sceneRootID` => `this.kernel.application()` changes from model/glge to model/threejs too.
- CHG: Make `this.scene.sceneRootID` => `this.kernel.application()` changes to the new functions `isPrototype` in model/glge and `ifPrototypeGetId` in model/threejs.
- CHG: Merge branch 'development' into branch/threejs for rebasing current source code branch with main development branch.
- NEW*: Update driver configuration to look for a config file of the same name as the application, rather than a hard-coded index
- CHG: Remove unneeded property setters on terrain. Fixes #1720.
- CHG: Remove obsolete, unused `useLegacyID` conditions.
- NEW*: Add `kernel.application` to identify the application node. Removes `index-vwf` references from the kernel and drivers and should allow any remaining assumptions about the `index.vwf` application name to be removed. Closes #1748.
- NEW: Accept `undefined` for `rootID`.
- NEW: Hide references to ancestors from uninitialized nodes in applications.
- NEW*: Register nodes with the kernel before `creatingNode` rather than during. The kernel delegates node metadata, such as the name, source/type fields, and the prototype and behaviors lists, to vwf/model/object. But since vwf/model/object is the last driver, relying on the normal order for `creatingNode` prevented other drivers from asking about prototypes and other node information in their `creatingNode` handlers.
- CHG: Kernel documentation updates.
- CHG: Finish `kernel.prototypes( ..., includeBehaviors )`.
- CHG: Pass the read-only kernel functions generically. They all pass straight through so there is no need to handle each one separately to be able to reinterpret the arguments.
- NEW: Add drive behavior to humvee app.
- CHG: Update humvee lesson to use controlValueUpdated event to trigger task completions.
- CHG: Update checks to not set properties if the value is null
- CHG: Remove the axis marker for GLGE. It was causing an ugly box to appear in the middle of the scene until the assets loaded, and it isn't visible in most scenes anyway. Fixes #1782.
- CHG: Fix bug with laser collision detection
- CHG: Removing physics.xml from xmas-tree application, and updating appscene to match physics app. Fixes #1781.
- CHG*: Revert the fixed-with tick and convert tests counting on it to `future`. Ticks for models are deprecated, so we don't want to add new functionality. The reflector would like to have flexibility to alter the tick interval on slow networks, so the interval can't be known to models. Views primarily need to know when the simulation time has changed since the simulation state won't change otherwise. `setTimeout` and `setInterval` are available for views to use for other timing needs.
- NEW: Add cameraTransformComplete event to task component.
- NEW: Humvee: Update gear shift, high-low selector and turn signal to use detent control positions

- NEW: Humvee: Added controlDisabled property to the control behavior. Fixes #1771
- CHG: Humvee: Move full humvee component and horn honk to lesson application. Refs #1585, #1770.
- CHG: Humvee: Add horn honk to humvee application. Fixes #1770.
- CHG: Humvee:  Move cameraPoses to lesson component, and reset initial camera position. Fixes #1585.
- CHG: Humvee:  Move lesson and humvee components into their own file, utilizing the includes directive. Refs #1585.
- NEW: Rudimentary support for `{ includes: prototype }`. The `includes` directive may used as an alternative to `extends` to work around certain cases where nodes don't inherit correctly from a prototype. Closes #1753.

- NEW: Update control types to allow text values. Refs #739
- CHG: Clean up logger statements
- CHG: Remove unnecessary check that would sometimes prevent the animationTime from being updated when the control value changed. Refs #1760

- NEW: Rough animation test case. Click the duck to play/pause. Control the time position using a hard-coded second slider under the editor's "Time" tab. The editor
patches cause several scripts errors on start.
- NEW: animation.vwf with working time, timeChange, events, and node update.
- CHG: Add terrain and background color to humvee-lesson. Fixes #1586. Add check to see if door is in proper position before moving to next lesson step.

- CHG: Add a check in bzflag/index.vwf.yaml for players being null. refs #1762
- CHG: Move bzflag scoreboard from appscene.vwf.yaml to index.vwf.yaml. scoreboard references players which is defined one level higher in index.vwf.yaml refs #1762
- CHG: Clean up loadCollada in GLGE model driver refs #1762
- CHG: In threejs.creatingNode, notify drivers of node's prototype properties. This fixes the problem that prototype properties were not being set int the renderer, so defaults were getting lost.  This commit fixes threejs.js, but the problem persists in glge.js. Also removed default ambient light in threejs.js because it is no longer necessary (taken care of by default value in scene.vwf) refs #1762
- NEW: ThreeJS: Spruce up lights in duck application a bit. refs #1680, #1682

- NEW: ThreeJS: Fix ColladaLoader to identify transparent textures as such. Remove unneeded backup. References #1680.
- NEW: ThreeJS: Restore `up_axis` to the original `Z_UP`. These were changed from `Z_UP` to `Y_UP` to `Z` during the axis excursions. three.js' Collada parser only looks at the first character, so the behavior should be the same. But we shouldn't keep a change for no reason. References #1680.
- NEW: ThreeJS: Undo unintentional comment-out and tweak formatting.
- NEW: ThreeJS: Fixed the spin axis for the propeller
- NEW: ThreeJS: Added JSON output for alt-click

- NEW: ThreeJS: GLGE Mouse pick fix when the editor is open or possibly when the view was scrolled
- NEW: ThreeJS: Don't rotate Collada objects after import. ColladaLoader's axis conversion will take care of this, and the correction would also incorrectly appear in the node3 transform. References #1680, #1556.
- NEW: ThreeJS: Set ColladaLoader options from the caller instead of modifying the source. This restores ColladaLoader.js to the upstream state, except for the
patch to honor Collada document names: 
- NEW: ThreeJS: Don't ignore the entire support/build directory. support/build/.gitignore has more precise patterns.
- NEW: ThreeJS: Add logic to allow overriding the renderer specified in a config file with URL parameters. Refs #1702.

- NEW: ThreeJS: support max and min spin in analyticShader
- NEW: ThreeJS: Three types of particle solver available. Euler can take into account drag, or in the future more complex sims, Analytic will do the analytic solution to the phyics sim cpu side. This works nicely, but takes some bandwidth on the GPU bus to upload each position at each frame. Analytic can take into account emitter movement properly. 'AnalyticShader' runs the analytic solution on the GPU. Much faster to compute and next to no data on the bus, but cannot take into account emitter movement.
- NEW: ThreeJS: added custom shader. now supporting start and end particle size. Can choose solver, either analytic or euler. Must use euler for damping. fixed timeing issue in frame counter. updated examples. Start and end color now take alphas
