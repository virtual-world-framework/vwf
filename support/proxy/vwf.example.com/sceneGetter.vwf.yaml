methods:

  # A helper that does basically what Find does, except that it handles some of
  #   the busywork (and assumes that we'll be looking in the scene).
  # Arguments: 
  #   objectName  - the string to search for
  findInScene:

  # Same as findInScene, except that this looks by type rather than by name.
  # Arguments: 
  #   typeName    - the type to search for
  findTypeInScene:
