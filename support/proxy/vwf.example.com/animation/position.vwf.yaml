## `animation/position.vwf` defines a key value for an animation.

---

properties:

  ## This position's location on the animation timeline. Valid values are in the range from `0` to
  ## the animation's duration.
  ## 
  ## Positions that don't provide `time` will be automatically distributed along the range between
  ## the siblings that do. If none of a node's animation positions provide `time`, then the
  ## positions will be distributed evenly throughout the animation--in the range [`0`, *duration*].

  animationTime:

  ## The animated node's transform at this position. The node's transform will be set to this value
  ## when the animations reaches this position. Transforms for intermediate postions will be
  ## interpolated from the transforms of the adjacent positions.

  animationTransform:

  # if no times, distribute evenly over number of children
  # transforms optional; only for node3 animations, and may be provided by asset or by node's update


  # animation positions and control positions are not necessarily coincident, although they typically are
  # animation data may be missing from control positions if no transform is necessary
  # control data may be missing from animation positions if value/time == 1, attraction does not change
