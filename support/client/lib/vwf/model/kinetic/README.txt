drawImage in Konva has been modified with a try catch to allow drawing to succeed on some edge cases for iOS devices.
This may cause drawing to fail silently. A warning has been provided. The fix will exist until an official Konva solution
is provided. Any questions: spencer.j.frazier@lmco.com or kevin.j.landers@lmco.com
