## `control/position.vwf` defines a key value for a control.




## Key value for a control.
## Builds on animation
## Time cross-references animation.
## Value specifies control value for this position. Node's name is name for that value/position/time.
## Attraction is stabiliby for this position. Think of time as a cursor at or between positions.
##   - Is attracted to some positions, valleys, detents
##   - Is repelled from some positions, hills, springs
##   - Is neutral with other positions, free range

---

properties:

  ## This position's location on the animation timeline. Valid values are in the range from `0` to
  ## the animation's duration.
  ## 
  ## Positions that don't provide `time` will be automatically distributed along the range between
  ## the siblings that do. If none of a control's positions provide `time`, then the positions will
  ## be distributed evenly throughout the animation--in the range [`0`, *duration*].

  animationTime:

  ## The control's value at this position. The control will report this value, along with the
  ## position's name, when it reaches this position.
  ## 
  ## Values for intermediate positions and for positions that don't define `value` will be
  ## interpolated from adjacent positions that do. If none of a control's positions define `value`,
  ## then the control will use the position's `time`.

  controlValue:

  ## The attraction or repulsion between the time cursor and this position. Positive values indicate
  ## attraction, negative values indicate repulsion, and `0` is netural. The strings `detent`,
  ## `spring` and `neutral` may be used to mean `1`, `-1` and `0`, respectively.

  ## Attracting positions define a detent--a location that the control will tend to snap to.
  ## Repelling positions define a spring-loaded location--one that the control will avoid except
  ## when held there.

  # TODO: held by how?

  controlType: 0


  # animation positions and control positions are not necessarily coincident, although they typically are
  # animation data may be missing from control positions if no transform is necessary
  # control data may be missing from animation positions if value/time == 1, attraction does not change
