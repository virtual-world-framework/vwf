# Virtual World Framework

The Virtual World Framework (VWF) allows you to build collaborative, immersive applications in the browser. VWF provides:

- Realtime state synchronization.
- Support for immersive applications - a set of drivers for 3D, audio, video and modern graphics.

VWF applications are written in JavaScript and leverage emerging web technologies such as WebGL, WebRTC, and WebSockets to provide a full 3D environment that is automatically synchronized across clients.

## Quick Start

Navigate to the VWF directory on your computer (`/var/www/vwf` on a *nix machine).

```
$ cd /var/www/vwf
```

Change directory into the public folder and create a new folder for your app.

```
$ cd public
$ mkdir my-app
```

To get started with VWF, check out [Getting Started](http://virtual.wf/web/docs/readme.html).

Go back to the root VWF directory and start the server.

```
$ cd /var/www/vwf
$ bundle exec thin start
```

Your application is now up and running at [http://localhost:3000/my-app](http://localhost:3000/my-app).
