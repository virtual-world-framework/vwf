## The component representation of a node - this is the base unit in VWF
##
## All components in an application extend node.vwf.  They can then add their own properties, 
## methods, events, and children.
##
## When a property is added to a component, its default value is null.
## Alternately, it can be given a starting value.  Here is an example in yaml:
##
##    properties:
##      myProperty: "fancy"
##
## Setter and getter functions can be added to control access to the property:
##
##    properties:
##      myProperty:
##        set: |
##          if ( value == "fancy" ) {
##            this.myProperty = value + " coding!";
##          } else {
##            this.myProperty = value;
##          }
##        get: |
##          return this.myProperty;
##        value: "fancy"
## 
## Note:
## If an incoming value is "transformed" before being set (as in the case above, where "coding!" 
## might be added to the end of the string), the value that will be sent with the "satProperty" 
## event will be the transformed value "fancy coding!", not the value that came into the setter 
## ("fancy").
## 
## @name node.vwf
## @namespace

## Note: This file is for documentation purposes only - these properties, methods, etc are actually internal VWF 
##       kernel operations.  Changing this file will not change how node works.
