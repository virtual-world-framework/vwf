- NEW: Branch/property delegation Refactor `getProperty` delegation to the behaviors and to the prototype.
- NEW: Branch/property delegation The `blocked` flag is no longer used during sets and gets.
- NEW: Branch/property delegation Update `getProperty` with `delegated`/`retrieved` like `setProperty`.

- NEW: Branch/property delegation Detect retrievals and delegations explicitly.
- NEW: Branch/property delegation Exit the `gettingProperty` loop on `delegated || retrieved` instead of on `value !== undefined`.
- NEW: Branch/property delegation Set the `entry.completed`/`reentry.completed` flag in an inner call so that the outer call won't reinvoke drivers already called when a property delegates to itself.
- NEW: Branch/property delegation Move delegation of the behaviors and prototype to not occur on the inner call when a property delegates to itself. This was unintentionally changed in commit:7d3dc92.

- NEW: Branch/property delegation Mark commented-out section of kernel node storage (methods and events) as TODO refs #2593
- NEW: Branch/property delegation Add comment to commented-out patches object to explain why it's commented out refs #2593
- NEW: Branch/property delegation Add documentation for the update of how property delegation behaves If a property setter transforms a property in a setter, satProperty is fired w/ the transformed value, not the original value
- NEW: Branch/property delegation Fire gotProperty event during replication when appropriate refs #2593
- NEW: Branch/property delegation Fix copy-paste error in getProperty refs #2593
- NEW: Branch/property delegation Fire satProperty event with the internal value when setProperty is called during replication. refs #2593
- NEW: Branch/property delegation Guard against cases when satProperty is called without an initializeProperty. The current implementation of property delegation allows an initializeProperty event to be skipped for properties that delegate. refs #2593
- NEW: Branch/property delegation Remove unused getPropertyValues function
- NEW: Branch/property delegation Modify getProperty to pass tests refs #2593
- NEW: Branch/property delegation Remove erroneous conditions that cause satProperty when it should not occur refs #2627
- NEW: Branch/property delegation Add tests to ensure "gets" and "sets" take proper path through drivers fixes #2563
- NEW: Branch/property delegation Detect delegation during property assignments. When a property assignment is executing, execution should stop once the property is assigned. If the kernel is configured with drivers A and B, for example, the kernel shouldn't call B if A handles the assignment. The existing implmentation only does this correctly when a property accepts the assignment directly or when it delegates to itself (such as
with `set: this.name = parseInt( value )`). If the assignment delegates to another property, this isn't considered assignment, and execution on
the initiating property continues with the remaining drivers. This causes extra work when invoking drivers lower in the stack for
properties that have already been delegated, change flags to be set on nodes that haven't actually changed (for example n, in the case of n.p
=> m.q), and properties delegating to other propertes to be incorrectly included in change sets (for example p in the case of n.p => n.q). This commit detects delegation to other properties by watching for other assignments made while executing `setProperty`. When delegation is
detected, execution completes just as it would if a driver accepted an assignment directly. Also, lots of tests. Closes #1635.
- NEW: Allow descriptors to declare properties without assigning a value. `kernel.createProperty( nodeID, name, undefined )` will create a new property without assigning an initial value. This can be useful if the property should have the value `undefined` or if a driver binds the node to an internal object that already has a value (such as `transform` in a Collada object). But since YAML and JSON have no representation for `undefined`, there has been no way to do the same thing using a component descriptor. This commit extends the detailed initializer format slightly to allow an `undefined` value to be explicitly declared:

    properties:
	  alpha:
	    "alpha"
	  beta:
	    value: "beta"
	  gamma:
	    undefined: true

`alpha` is created with the value `"alpha"` using a simple initializer. `beta` is created with the value `"beta"` using a detailed initializer.
And `gamma` is created using a detailed initializer with the initial value undefined.

- NEW: Track kernel re-entry originating with aggregate property sets and gets. Set the markers so that if `kernel.setProperties` or
`kernel.getProperties` set or get a property having an accessor function that refers back to the property, or if a driver calls back to the
kernel to refer to the property, `setProperty` or `getProperty` will start the action with the correct driver. Previously, only actions originating with `setProperty` or `getProperty` were tracked this way. This commit adds tracking for actions originating in `setProperties` and `getProperties` as well.
- NEW:  Only record changed properties in `getState`. Previously, after any property changed on a patchable node, `getNode` (which feeds `getState`) would include all of the node's properties in the patch. Now, only the properties that actually changed are included. Fixes #2236.
- NEW: Begin moving the node registry to the kernel from model/object. The kernel has been delegating knowledge of the node graph and node
change flags to the model/object driver. But this doesn't work well since model/object isn't normally notified about changes to a node until
after the other drivers. Extra calls into model/object are in place so that preceding drivers can ask about a node's ancestors or prototypes in
creatingNode, for example, but this is an abuse of the driver API. Tracking changes in model/object also requires extra work since
model/object doesn't see changes to properties handled by other drivers. Change flags may not be set in some cases, which can cause replication
errors. The kernel will be better off if it manages this data itself. With a local registry, it will be easier for the kernel to register a new node
just before it is first exposed to any driver and unregister a deleted node right after its last driver message. This commit creates the node and per-node property registries, and records per-node property change flags. Fixes #1815.
- CHG: Update KimRayValve to kimray. Closes #2952
- CHG: Fixes the issue with clients not initialiy syncing up correctly UCE - Fixes 2263 and there was a bug listed in VWF for this as well, but can't find the number




----------------------------------
0.6.17 and 0.6.18 Combined Release
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: (*) indicates an API change. 0.6.17 and 0.6.18 were combined into a single release do to internal sprint planning changes.

Server:
- NEW: Merge pull request #47 from virtual-world-framework/branch/headless-qunit. Headless QUnit - Run qunit tests from command line. Move the qunit tests into the client Rakefile and update docs. Update docs with instructions to handle spaces in paths. Support paths with spaces across Windows and Mac. Added bundle exec to call. Update testing.md. Document how to run qunit tests. Add descriptions to tasks so they show up in 'rake -T'. Enable phantomjs to run on Windows. Check if phantomjs is installed before trying to run qunit tests. Pull phantomjs binary location from ENV. Add `kernel.views.actual` to match models, and update tests to use. This duplicates some code, but branch/model-sandbox moves the pipeline-following function to the driver modules so it will be short-lived. Update Gemfile.lock after pulling out the phantomjs gem. Include rake test:qunit in the rake test run so that all tests are run by rake test. Add expect nothing to broken tests to meet new qunit requirements. Improve console output from run-qunit and rake task. Remove phantomjs gem because not needed. Add a task for running the qunit tests using phantomjs. Add qunit runner for phantomjs. Upgrade qunit to most recent version
- NEW: Merge pull request #58 from virtual-world-framework/branch/node-doc. Add Node.js Server documentation. Add node-inspector configuration options to nodejs documentation Refs #2828. Add Node.js Server installation, execution, & debugging instructions.  Fixes #2855. Create Node Server 'Logs' directory on demand.  Fixes #2828
- CHG: Create Node Server 'Logs' directory on demand. Refs #2828
- CHG: Update install.md to include SSL setup instructions. Fixes #2807
- NEW: Streamline node package list. Add debug script for running node in debug mode. Switch out https for http npm registry. Adjust node module version strings. Set dependencies to N.N.x in order to retrive the most recent patches. Set devDependences to x.x.x to be the most expansive. For development tools, I assume we want the most recent versions, always. Removed all unused packages. I think I *only* removed unused packages, so if you notice something missing, add it back in! Upgraded libraries to the most recent versions. Switched to 0.0.x semantic versioning for specifying dependencies. The ".x" in the version will pull in patches, but not minor or major version changes. Changed sections referring to ADL to refer to VWF. Added start script so you can start the server by typing `npm start`. Moved testing and debugging tools to devDependencies so that they won't be installed in production. Changed license to Apache 2 from MIT. Regenerated `npm-shrinkwrap.json` with the new packages.

Client:
- NEW: Shift Key now allows for MouseMiddleDown behavior when held down and a mouse click is made. This allows a user without a middle mouse button to still access the orbit functionality. Fixes #2901

Demonstration Applications:
- NEW: 2D Editor Example Application
- NEW: Add link to Kimray Valve Demo to VWF main website.

----------------------------------
0.6.16
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: (*) indicates an API change.

Server:
- CHG: Add flag to the Threejs View Driver to check if there is an outstanding getProperty request on 'userObject'.  This eliminates the issue of creating multiple user nodes in gotProperty (not currently implemented through a callback). Fixes #2671
- FIX: Updates threejs onresize behavior to adjust viewport based on the webgl canvas without the unused border included. Fixes #2800. 
- NEW: Add initial implementation of the node.js server. 

Client:
- NEW: Add new properties for controlling shadows. Refs #2806
- CHG: Fix bug linking the animationRate to the threejs driver. Deprecate fps property, and add new read-only property animationFPS that only comes from the collada model. Add new animationFrameCount and animationFrame properties. Allow for negative animationRate. Refs #2801

Demonstration Applications:
- Command Center: Texture Update for backboard. Fixes #2668
- Command Center: Fix bad path for command-center artwork.
- Write Togeter: Create a new 2D editor application for collaborate document creation. 
- Radio Lesson: Updates the 'turn the radio on' step of the lesson to listen for control value updated events rather than pointer up events. Fixes #2590.

Documentation:
- CHG: Update spacing on readme.md file for the 'Getting Started' documentation page. Fixes #2716. 
- CHG: Crispen warning about unzipping build w/ Windows utility. Fixes #2808

Test Applications:
- NEW: Add multi-nav-test app to debug Redmine #2671.



----------------------------------
0.6.15
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: (*) indicates an API change.

Server: 
- NEW: Load the application chrome as a service instead of a file. Instead of having the client parse the URL and guess at the application name, load the `application.vwf.html` overlay using a fixed path relative to the application root. Since applications aren't required to provide an overlay, return an empty result with status code 200 when the overlay doesn't exist. Otherwise, the log will show an error for a condition that isn't really an error. Closes #741.
- NEW: Load the application chrome from view/document instead of the kernel. Test for the application explicitly rather than using the kernel's heuristic. Prevents attempting to load *component*.vwf.html for components referenced by the application. Suspend loading the application while the chrome document loads. Synthesize a `createdNode` call for the application node when the chrome provides a `createdNode` handler. Allows the chrome's `vwf_view` handlers to observe all of the actions for the document--not just the ones that occur after the chrome happens to load. Closes #188.
- NEW: Kernel reentry should be off for deferred properties too.
- NEW: Remove need for ./Log directory for Nodejs server default LogLevel.

Client:
- NEW: Add drag touch gesture to emulate fly behavior. Add ability to switch camera.touchmode to "orbit" or "none" as well. Orbit is minimally supported, but needs work. Remove hmmwv-touch application. Fixes #2604.
- NEW: Fixes bug in GetAllMaterials helper function which broke materials in some models for GetMaterials. Fixes #2681.
- NEW: Adds a isIdentityMatrix function, which was previously called despite not existing. Fixes #1927.
- NEW: Modifies CloneMaterial to take into account the difference between THREE.Material and THREE.MeshFaceMaterial. Fixes #2677.
- NEW: Add automatic generation of not yet represented materials to the threejs node creation process. Updates the material name to material matching system to support potential 'multiple identical yet distinct' materials. Fixes #2159.
- NEW: Load scripts from external URIs. 
- NEW: Process scripts in a separate async block. This is in preparation for loading scripts from external resources, which will be an async operation.
- NEW: Accept a single item in addition to an array for behaviors and scripts. Closes #173.
- NEW: Select the correct socket.io port when the application uses the default. References #2674.
- NEW: Use SSL WebSockets for SSL applications. Fixes #2674.
- NEW: Add additional mod to Rob's Asset Cache Material Clone fix (315ca5ff079043e4f658946952d7bf136b34b217).  Fixes #2617
- NEW: Move the `transforms.transit` normalization just before the socket send. Parameter and result values need to be normalized before they are converted to JSON and sent to the reflector. Specifically, Array-like objects must be converted to Arrays so that they pass through JSON serialization and deserialization properly. Actions initiated by views and sent using `kernel.send` weren't being normalized this way. This commit moves normalization into `kernel.send` and `kernel.respond` to ensure that it is applied consistently for each outgoing message. Other `transforms.transit` normalizations done in anticipation of the result being sent to the reflector are redundant and have been removed. The patch to explicitly convert array-likes to arrays in view/threejs is now also redundant and has been removed. Fixes #2666.
- NEW: Move processing of load portions of URL out of VWF::Pattern and into VWF::Application::Persistence.  Update editor panel and pattern test to work with the slightly changed URL syntax for loading saves that this produced. Fixes #2654.
- NEW: Updated regex to capture only .vwf.html files for 404 custom page. Fixes #2637

Demonstration Applications: 
- Marbles: Alters marbles material definitions in the YAML so that they properly identify materials in the collada model files. Fixes #2672.
- Cesium WebRTC: Fix Google Chrome location error in cesium-webrtc. If the location query returns and invalid response and presents an error, the billboard and associated label will be hidden. Fixes #2648. Fixes #2600.
- Command Center: add blank tv screens to the side wall televisions.  Fixes #2557
- Command Center: Migrate command-center to threejs.  Fixes #2663
- AGI/Cesium: Add check to only create the billboard and label in cesium is the geographic location is valid. This reimplements 2541c151879be9e3f029fdee0190099d14ddde8f. Fixes #2600.

----------------------------------
0.6.14
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: (*) indicates an API change.

Server: 
- NEW: Initial phase of node.js server integration from Pull Request #10.  Fixes #2495 #2496
- NEW: Add functionality to save and load from separate directory structure. Add new pattern matching to server that provides readable load and save URL's. Add basic support for save revisions, using the UTC timestamp in seconds as a revision number. References #2315. References #2534.
- NEW: Add support to the reflectors first connection flow to allow starting at non-zero times. Add functionality so that when loading initial state from JSON, time from JSON state is used as initial time.  Remove stripping of the queue from the editor save state functionality. References #2315. References #2534.
- NEW: Add additional means of requesting lists of saved files. Provide either a list of all saved files, or find all saved files that are at or a descendant of a certain URL. Updated the user panel of the editor to use the new 'list all save files' feature, and include an application name as part of the option label. Fixes #2533. Fixes #2315. Fixes #2534.

Client:
- NEW: Add touch events to node2 and node3 components (similar to pointer events), so that touch events may be extended in these component types. Fixes #2502.
- NEW: Ensure that proper reflector messages are ignored by view/threejs.js. The navigation system updates the view immediately and should therefore ignore the reflector message associated w/ that update.  Previously, it kept track of the number of messages it sent out and assumed that the next n messages that came in with a client id that matched its own were the ones to be ignored.  However, since other parts of the system can also make transform updates, this was not adequate. It now fires an event before updating the transform so it can listen for the event to know what to ignore. fixes #2505
- CHG: Rename variables in view/threejs.js. Avoid name conflicts w/ global and local "translation". Change outstandingTransformRequestToBeIgnored to outstandingTransformRequests refs #2505
- CHG: Refactor scene.vwf.yaml - reorder scripts to match methods refs #2505
- CHG: Remove unreachable intervalTimer variable and move to driver initialization. Fixes #2488.
- CHG: Set node3 transform to "value" when worldTransform is set on a node without a parent. Refs #2226.
- NEW: Add check that renderer and viewCam exist before setting viewport or aspect. Fixes #2466.
- NEW: Merge Pull Request #13 (assetCache Part II). Fixes #2576 #2570
- CHG: Adds a toArray function for a utility.color instance, useful for converting colors to vwf friendly values
- CHG: Adds the capture and color property for clients For task: 2548
- CHG: Put check in object.js for object being undefined. This will happen if there is no object with the nodeID provided to the internals() function.  We have only seen this happen when a second client joins and children of a node are added in a different order, resulting in node ids that don't match.  We do not know what caused that, and we cannot reproduce it (it only happened once).  As a result, we have placed this check to see if we can catch it in the act. I am marking the associated task as complete for now. fixes #2558
- CHG: Don't store models with keyframe animations in the asset cache, since we can't clone those successfully. Refs #2586
- CHG: Move cloneMaterials call outside the check for animations so it will clone the materials for animated models too Refs #2586
- CHG: Add basic tap and pinch-to-zoom touch gesture support to threejs driver. Tap currently emulates pointerUp, Down, and Click events to support current application implementation. Update humvee-lesson 'Walk to Vehicle Step' to support both mouse wheel and pinch-to-zoom. Refs #2456. Fixes #2598.
- CHG: Fix setting castShadow property on threejs objects. Add resetViewport event to fix blank screen issue when shadows are enabled. Refs #2567
- CHG: Adds a centralized way to debug node creation and properties.
- CHG: Add new properties to the light behaviour for controlling shadows Refs #2567
- NEW: config.ru update to resolve #2216 and mask 404 errors on autogeneratedd files.
- NEW: Added new 404 page for VWF style page. Resolves #2216.
- CHG: Remove remote URL call for font WOFF file from googleapis.com and serve file from local client for bootstrap usage calls. fixes #2614

- CHG: BZFlag: Change player login procedure to check for username overlaps and prevent them. Fixes #2577.
- CHG: Duck-Lesson: Remove duck lesson application, as we now have more complex humvee and radio lessons. Fixes #2599.
- CHG: Humvee: Move humvee and humvee-lesson to use threejs by default. Update color and emit properties for Brake and Wait lights to work better in threejs. Lower navigation speed inside the humvee. Fixes #2349
- CHG: Humvee: Tone down the specular property on humvee materials. Remove VWF lights, since there are lights in the humvee model. Refs #2349
- CHG: Humvee-Lesson: Move humvee and humvee-lesson to use threejs by default. Update color and emit properties for Brake and Wait lights to work better in threejs. Lower navigation speed inside the humvee. Fixes #2349
- CHG: Humvee-Lesson: Decrease wait time for "Move Ignition to Start" in humvee-lesson. Fixes #2127.
- CHG: Humvee-Lesson: Add listener for pointerWheel on step 1.1 of humvee-lesson. Fixes #2587.
- CHG: Marbles: Enable shadows in marbles app Refs #2567

- CHG Cesium-WebRTC: Updates the functions between the document view and the webrtc view
- CHG Cesium-WebRTC: Uses the root level clients list to determine when a client leaves and then remove the appropriate windows when a client leaves Fixes: http://redmine.virtualworldframework.com/issues/2564
- CHG: Sandtable: Add light to sandtable scene to show shadows/depth. Lighten black pushpin so its shadows are visible. Fixes #2418

----------------------------------
0.6.12
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: (*) indicates an API change.

Server: 

- NEW: Create a global `clients.vwf` node and maintain one child per client. The server creates the global node `http://vwf.example.com/clients.vwf` on launch (independent of the application) then adds one child to it for each client connected to the application instance. The child's name is the client's moniker. In the default implementation, neither the `clients.vwf` node nor its children contain any additional data. It is expected that server installations that have user data to share will make that available to the application by creating the nodes with additional behaviors and properties. References #1272.

Client:

- NEW: Client: Implement mouse orbit refs #2258 fixes #2339
- NEW*: API: Add `kernel.deleteChild` to delete a node by name. References #1272.
- NEW*: API: Support annotations on top-level nodes and mark the application. Add a `nodeAnnotation` parameter to `createNode` to allow top-level nodes to be tagged. Interpret the "application" annotation as identifying the root of the application tree. Update the replication data to include the tags. This replaces the previous heuristic of treating the first node created as the application root. References #1272.
- CHG: Client: Set the default value for active to false for the scenejs renderer
- CHG: Client: Add in proper support for threejs nodes with multiple materials.
- CHG: Client: Add in basic bumpScale option to control degree of bump mapping. References #2311.
- CHG: Client: Fix for when findClients returns undefined. Refs #2424.
- CHG: Client: Make spin-on-click only respond to left-clicks. fixes #2339
- CHG: Client: Limit scroll speed to 9 times the translation speed. The idea is that if you scroll backward so far that things get clipped by the far plane or become so small that you can't scroll back in on them, it should only take you three scrolls forward on empty space (3 clicks per scroll) to get back where you were.  This solves the problem where a person can scroll out and get totally lost. fixes #2257
- CHG: Client: Maintain a current list of clients in an application. As each client joins an application instance, a node is created as a child of the "clients" node, which is parallel to the application root node. Add a findClients kernel function, similar to the find function. Whereas the find function finds nodes descending from the application root node, the findClients function finds nodes descending from the clients node.The Users tab of the editor shows a list of all clients in the application instance. A user can choose to login, which will add a displayName property to its client node. This can be seen by drilling down into that client in the editor. Fixes #1951. Fixes #1998. Fixes #1275.
- CHG: Client: Add sourceUrl to node3.transform.set for debugging refs #2259
- CHG: Client: Fix FindChildByName so recursive calls recurse all the way down The next level down was not calling itself recursively so it only ever went down one level refs #2259
- CHG: Client: Change key navigation while orbiting (and disable look and scroll). WS now move the user toward and away from the orbit point. ADQE now orbit the camera laterally around the orbit point. Right-click to rotate camera and scroll are disabled while middle mouse wheel are down. fixes #2258
- CHG: Client: Make ThreeJSPick only return visible objects (ignoring invisible ones) refs #2258
- CHG: Client: Added check when setting navmode to none to release cursor. Fixes #2374.
- CHG: Client: Remove extra assignment of self variable refs #2257
- CHG: Client: Make scroll-to-zoom work in Firefox, too refs #2257
- CHG: Client: Move a "translationSpeed" distance when scrolling over a non-object refs #2257
- CHG: Client: Add error checking to editor.js refs #2257
- CHG: Client: Add scroll-to-zoom navigation in "fly" mode fixes #2257
- CHG: Client: Disable pointer lock when navigation mode is "none". refs #2038

Note: (*) indicates an API change.

Server Changes

- CHG: Server: Don't rewrite times when forwarding the pending client messages. They were stamped with the correct times when they were added to the queue. Connected clients received them with those times, so clients that are connecting should receive them the same way.
- CHG: Server: Use reflector client ids instead of Ruby object ids in log messages.
- CHG: Server: Do not remove pending clients from list when we log them refs #2182
- CHG: Server: Watch for new async actions started during an async action and resolve. Async operations need to complete in a consistent manner in order for the replication computation to work correctly across multiple clients.If a queue action starts one more more async operations, the operations need to complete before the next queue item is started. And they need to complete in the same order they were started. If an async action starts other async actions, the outer action shouldn't complete until the inner actions have completed. For example, if a node's `initiailze` calls `node.children.create`, wait for the child node to finish initializing before allowing the parent node to complete. Fixes #2137.
- CHG: Server: Switch `/* ( p1, p2 ) */` callback comment notation to `/* p1, p2 */`.
- CHG: Server: Move the test utility functions to a shared utility module.
- CHG: Server: Fix test/replication.html, broken in commit:aa0849b.
- CHG: Server: Send setState only to new joiners, not to everyone refs #2182
- CHG: Server: Use the minified client in production mode when available.
- CHG: Server: Add nil check for request.env["HTTP USER AGENT"] in ruby browser check. Refs #2076.
- CHG: Server: Add unsupported browser documentation page, and a redirect to it in the ruby code if a user launches a demo in IE8. Fixes #2076.
- CHG: Server: Use `setState`+`createNode` to launch since `setState` resets the queue. Fixes #2207. References #2122, #2106, #2167.
- CHG: Server: Update build_redhat.sh. Removed the call to turn off IPTables, and updated the note to the system administrator to allow port 80 traffic. Fixes #1617
- CHG: Server: Added information to use WinZip, WinRAR, or 7-Zip to unzip a package from the downloads page. Also fixed up numbering issues, cleaned up layout, and general other housekeeping items to cleanup the page.  fixes #2050
- CHG: Server: Repaired issue of catalog page auto deleting after first build. Fixes #2065
- CHG: Server: Updated the Rakefile to remove HTML files autogenerated from a previous build.  Fixes #2065
- CHG: Server: Update component Rakefile to build docs for child directories of vwf.example.com and update doc syntax to properly display. Fixes #1779 and fixes #1629.
- CHG: Server: Schedule future actions in front of reflector actions at the same time. Previously, if future and reflector actions were placed in the message queue with the same execution time, they would be arranged in order of arrival. But this would leave the queue in an indeterminate state. Since reflector messages arrive at different clients at different times, clients wouldn't order these sequences consistently. Additionally, it's probably expected that when an action generates a future action at delta time 0, the new action will run before a new external action executes--even if an external action for the current time has already arrived. Now, the message queue is sorted first by time, as before, then by origin to place future actions in front of reflector actions, then by arrival order, as before. This ensures that a sequence of future
actions, including one that generates new actions for the same time, will always run to completion before a reflector action executes, regardless of whether the external action arrives before, during or after the sequence starts executing. Fixes #2123.
- CHG: Server: Don't remove reflector messages in `setState` sent after the action. When updating the message queue to match the incoming specification, `setState` previously cleared the queue except for messages with a `respond` field. But that would delete messages sent after the `setState` that arrived before it finished executing. Those messages apply to the new state and should be retained. The correct process is to delete all future messages, including any generated during the `setState` since the incoming queue contains the correct messages for the new state, delete any reflector messages that arrived before the `setState` but were scheduled to execute at a later
time, but retain any reflector messages that arrived after the `setState`. Fixes #2122.

Client Changes

- CHG: Client: Fix bug w/ malformed pointerUp messages
- CHG: Client: Check for when pointerDownID is null and do not send the pointerUp event fixes #2243
- CHG: Client: Stop key-based movement when window goes out of focus. Key presses are going somewhere else when that happens. This fixes the bug where if a user pressed a key and then clicked on another window, the app would not register the key-up event and the user would continue to move w/o the key being down. fixes #366
- CHG: Client: Remove code to detect button states onmouseover that is obsolete. It didn't work anyway, but is made unnecessary by the fix that uses document.onmouseup to catch mouse-up events outside the window. refs #366
- CHG: Client: Listen for onmouseup on document instead of canvas. document will catch mouseup events that occur outside the window and fixes the bug where the app would think the mouse button was still down if the user moused-up outside the window and then re-entered refs #366
- CHG: Client: Add support for setting setting fps, start and stop frames to the animation behavior. Fixes #2250
- CHG: Client: Add support for making a user's own avatar invisible to himself. refs #2180
- CHG: Client: Add property to scene to make avatars invisible to their user. fixes #2180
- CHG: Client: Add comment about assumption in navscene.vwf.yaml refs #2265
- CHG: Client: Remove camera creation from GLGE model driver. It is now created in scene.vwf. refs #2265
- CHG: Client: Add debug code to find issue w/ navigation hopping and skipping. refs #2182
- CHG: Client: Replace vwf references in lesson view driver. Fixes #2097.
- CHG: Client: Add error checking for cameraNode to be null in view/threejs.js refs #2252
- CHG: Client: Separate disabling of view side nav from setting navscene nav. Disabling the view-side nav only needs to happen once, but setting the navscene nav might happen many times. refs #2252
- CHG: Client: Do not assign backup camera is activeCamera does not yet exist. This was leading to second clients having a prototype camera set as the one they were looking through (which made it unresponsive) - this was first seen in the tutorial apps. refs #2252
- CHG: Client: Update tutorials to initialize camera properties in a future call. refs #2252
- CHG: Client: Have navscene.vwf.yaml automatically disable view-side navigation. refs #2252
- CHG: Client: Move initialization of navscene navigation mode to future call. For now, we cannot assume that the camera has already been created in initialize - so we must wait until the queue resumes to know that it is there.  This will change once initialize waits for all nodes created inside it to complete before being done refs #2252
- CHG: Client: Update nodeHasOwnChild to manually loop over children to check the names, if the child name is numeric. Refs #2085
- CHG: Client: Update sourceURLs refs #2252
- CHG: Client: Update threeObject matrixWorld before using it in nodeLookAt. Was causing the sandtable camera position not to update. refs #2252
- CHG: Client: Explicitly set animation start and stop time in the node3 animation functions, so that the stop time is correct if the functions are called more than once. Refs #1953
- CHG: Client: Fix null reference exception in nodeLookAt. refs #2019
- CHG: Client: Fix bug where view was ignoring transform updates on own navObject. refs #2019
- CHG: Client: Expose translationSpeed and rotationSpeed in navigable.vwf.yaml. fixes #2197
- CHG: Client: Fix bug where "self" was being used locally and resetting global. refs #1972
- CHG: Client: Remove hard-coded node id from scene.vwf.yaml. refs #2186
- CHG: Client: Fix lookat. refs #2019
- CHG: Client: Remove extra newline from navigable.vwf.yaml. refs #2019
- CHG: Client: Remove code that sets view camera from the model. This is now exclusively done in controlNavObject(). Also, put some checks in for when node is null. fixes #2088
- CHG: Client: Add check for node being null in receiveModelTransformChanges. Also add some comments and rearrange some logic to make it more clear and efficient. refs #2019
- CHG: Client: Fix bug where user could not navigate w/ mouse keys. We were not always updating the three.js world matrix of the navigation object (and therefore, its children were not getting updated). refs #2027
- CHG: Client: Fix could not move navObject w/ mouse or keys. The three.js objects were auto-updating their matrices from their position and orientation values, overwriting the matrix that we had set. refs #2027
- CHG: Client: Fix camera coming in w/ unexpected 90 degree rotation on it. If a camera was a child of the navObject, but not the main navObject, its model and view transforms were not properly separated.  This checkin separates those transforms for all node3s, and fixes a bug where initial transforms were not properly being adopted on initializeProperty. refs #2027
- CHG: Client: Have second user create his own navigable object. fixes #1969. 
- CHG: Client: Change error messages to use errorx for extra context information. refs #2019
- CHG: Client: Add error checking to object driver. refs #2027
- CHG: Client: Resolve merge conflicts from rebase of navigation onto development. refs #2027
- CHG: Client: Add userObject property to scene.vwf.yaml for independent navigation. This object describes what will be created for each user as their "user object".  It usually includes a camera and an avatar in some configuration refs #1969
- CHG: Client: Do not look for children before they're attached (in controlNavObject). refs #1969
- CHG: Client: Remove trace code from navigation code in threejs.js view driver. refs #2019
- CHG: Client: Fix bug where second user would not always sync to scene.vwf.yaml. I was updating the view transform in satProperty, but not in initializedProperty, so the view was staying out of sync until the next set came through Also includes changes to allow the application to specify a navigation object that the user will be given control of. Also fixed a bug where the pointerOut event was being thrown on an undefined node fixes #1963 refs #1969
- CHG: Client: Remove properties from camera component that refer to navigation refs #1963
- CHG: Client: Make key presses control navObject position, not camera position directly refs #1963
- CHG: Client: Remove 90 degree unrotation from camera getProperty that is no longer needed refs #1963
- CHG: Client: Add check for non-existant node to core "nodeHasProperty" method refs #1963
- CHG: Client: Handle incoming transform requests from reflector (in threejs view driver)
- CHG: Client: Check mouse state onmouseover so we stay synched w/ mouse state refs #1960
- CHG: Client: Create camera dynamically in scene.vwf.yaml when appropriate. It was added as a child in the .yaml, but since children are not inherited from prototypes, the application did not get the child camera.  Now it is created dynamically in initialize if the usersShareView property is set to true (otherwise users will create their own "navigable" object) fixes #1970
- CHG: Client: Make viewTransform copy values, not reference to model transform. The viewTransform was copying the reference, so every time the model changed, it would clobber the view transform. refs #1960
- CHG: Client: Constrain camera pitch to +/- 90 degrees refs #1960
- CHG: Client: Navigation refactoring continued. Put camera in scene.vwf and removed default camera creation from Threejs model driver.  Required a callback workaround in the Threejs view driver that can be removed once the kernel implements the creatChild callback.
- CHG: Client: Allow user to change camera orientation w/ right-click and drag refs #1960
- CHG: Client: Hide right-click context menu when navigating refs #1960
- CHG: Client: Fix bug where pressing two mouse buttons would cause bad things. refs #1960
- CHG: Client: Remove unnecessary consoleOut refs #2019
- CHG: Client: Remove reference to kernel.kernel in view/threejs.js refs #2019

Demonstration Application Changes

- CHG: All: Update GLGE apps to initialize camera properties in future call.

Added debug function that can be manually invoked, and automatically is invoked when oddities occur. Displays view side user information as well as causes all attached users models to provide similar information. Fixes #2168
- CHG: DemoChat Demo: Initial update. Heartbeat still unchanged, but login now uses vwf_view.kernel.moniker comparison to client that issued event in order to simplify identifying user/view pairs. Fixes #2168

For now, we cannot assume that the camera has already been created in initialize - so we must wait until the queue resumes to know that it is there.  This will change once initialize waits for all nodes created inside it to complete before being done. refs #2252
- CHG: Sandtable Demo: Disable view-side navigation in sandtable so navscene can do it. Leaving this app using navscene until the view-side navigation has an middle-mouse button orbit. refs #2252

----------------------------------
0.6.7
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: (*) indicates an API change.

- CHG: Fix typos in lesson for GameTech Demonstration of Virtual World Framework.
- CHG: Remove old work-around for orientation problems. Not needed after the orientation fixes, plus it was making a direct kernel reference and using an invalid static ID. References #1680.
- CHG: Revert terrain z position and camera far changes from commit:6576d61. Raising the terrain would allow the camera to rotate to see underneath it. The distance to the far end of the terrain with the default orbit radius is approximatly 40000. The previous far value of 500000 should still be OK. References #1680.
- CHG: changed implements: //vwf.example.com/control.vwf to 'control-old.vwf' to account for threejs merge
- CHG: Explicity disable specular highlights in the humvee applications.
- CHG: Humvee lesson updates: Rename cameraPoses to more meaningful names.
- CHG: Humvee lesson updates: Added simple drive capability attached to 'G' key.
- CHG: Humvee lesson updates: Pass the key events down to the humvee
- CHG: Humvee lesson updates: Added the ability for the user to take control of the humvee
- CHG: Humvee lesson updates: Made some functions local due to issues calling those functions within the behavior
- CHG: Humvee lesson updates: Added resetting the humvee mode when entering the lesson
- CHG: Humvee lesson updates: Added support to remember the last active camera
- CHG: Humvee lesson updates: Merge branch 'branch/threejs' of http://github.com/virtual-world-framework/vwf into branch/threejs
- CHG: Humvee lesson updates: Remove empty `value:` fields from components.
- CHG: Humvee lesson updates: Rather than not setting a value, these were actually setting a value of `null`.
- CHG: Humvee lesson updates: Don't presume the application ID in the driver `initialize`.
- CHG: Apply the `this.scene.sceneRootID` => `this.kernel.application()` changes from model/glge to model/threejs too.
- CHG: Make `this.scene.sceneRootID` => `this.kernel.application()` changes to the new functions `isPrototype` in model/glge and `ifPrototypeGetId` in model/threejs.
- CHG: Merge branch 'development' into branch/threejs for rebasing current source code branch with main development branch.
- NEW*: Update driver configuration to look for a config file of the same name as the application, rather than a hard-coded index
- CHG: Remove unneeded property setters on terrain. Fixes #1720.
- CHG: Remove obsolete, unused `useLegacyID` conditions.
- NEW*: Add `kernel.application` to identify the application node. Removes `index-vwf` references from the kernel and drivers and should allow any remaining assumptions about the `index.vwf` application name to be removed. Closes #1748.
- NEW: Accept `undefined` for `rootID`.
- NEW: Hide references to ancestors from uninitialized nodes in applications.
- NEW*: Register nodes with the kernel before `creatingNode` rather than during. The kernel delegates node metadata, such as the name, source/type fields, and the prototype and behaviors lists, to vwf/model/object. But since vwf/model/object is the last driver, relying on the normal order for `creatingNode` prevented other drivers from asking about prototypes and other node information in their `creatingNode` handlers.
- CHG: Kernel documentation updates.
- CHG: Finish `kernel.prototypes( ..., includeBehaviors )`.
- CHG: Pass the read-only kernel functions generically. They all pass straight through so there is no need to handle each one separately to be able to reinterpret the arguments.
- NEW: Add drive behavior to humvee app.
- CHG: Update humvee lesson to use controlValueUpdated event to trigger task completions.
- CHG: Update checks to not set properties if the value is null
- CHG: Remove the axis marker for GLGE. It was causing an ugly box to appear in the middle of the scene until the assets loaded, and it isn't visible in most scenes anyway. Fixes #1782.
- CHG: Fix bug with laser collision detection
- CHG: Removing physics.xml from xmas-tree application, and updating appscene to match physics app. Fixes #1781.
- CHG*: Revert the fixed-with tick and convert tests counting on it to `future`. Ticks for models are deprecated, so we don't want to add new functionality. The reflector would like to have flexibility to alter the tick interval on slow networks, so the interval can't be known to models. Views primarily need to know when the simulation time has changed since the simulation state won't change otherwise. `setTimeout` and `setInterval` are available for views to use for other timing needs.

- NEW: Update control types to allow text values. Refs #739
- CHG: Clean up logger statements

- NEW: Rough animation test case. Click the duck to play/pause. Control the time position using a hard-coded second slider under the editor's "Time" tab. The editor
patches cause several scripts errors on start.

- CHG: Clean up loadCollada in GLGE model driver refs #1762
- CHG: In threejs.creatingNode, notify drivers of node's prototype properties. This fixes the problem that prototype properties were not being set int the renderer, so defaults were getting lost.  This commit fixes threejs.js, but the problem persists in glge.js. Also removed default ambient light in threejs.js because it is no longer necessary (taken care of by default value in scene.vwf) refs #1762

- NEW: ThreeJS: GLGE Mouse pick fix when the editor is open or possibly when the view was scrolled
- NEW: ThreeJS: Don't rotate Collada objects after import. ColladaLoader's axis conversion will take care of this, and the correction would also incorrectly appear in the node3 transform. References #1680, #1556.
- NEW: ThreeJS: Set ColladaLoader options from the caller instead of modifying the source. This restores ColladaLoader.js to the upstream state, except for the
patch to honor Collada document names: 
- NEW: ThreeJS: Don't ignore the entire support/build directory. support/build/.gitignore has more precise patterns.
- NEW: ThreeJS: Add logic to allow overriding the renderer specified in a config file with URL parameters. Refs #1702.

- NEW: ThreeJS: support max and min spin in analyticShader
- NEW: ThreeJS: Three types of particle solver available. Euler can take into account drag, or in the future more complex sims, Analytic will do the analytic solution to the phyics sim cpu side. This works nicely, but takes some bandwidth on the GPU bus to upload each position at each frame. Analytic can take into account emitter movement properly. 'AnalyticShader' runs the analytic solution on the GPU. Much faster to compute and next to no data on the bus, but cannot take into account emitter movement.
- NEW: ThreeJS: added custom shader. now supporting start and end particle size. Can choose solver, either analytic or euler. Must use euler for damping. fixed timeing issue in frame counter. updated examples. Start and end color now take alphas
