# Persistence in VWF

## Terms

- **Application** - Any component file, described in YAML or JSON, intended to 
  be run as a complete application.
- **Instance** - An occurrence of an *application* with a distinct *state* for
  clients to interact with.
    - **Running Instance** - An *instance* with active clients connected to it.
    - **Instance ID** - The unique identifier for an *instance* of an 
      *application*. Currently represented by a random 16-digit sequence of 
      letters and numbers.
- **State** - The values for all internal properties of an *instance* of an 
  *application*.
- **Save state** - The persisted *state* of an *instance* of an *application* 
  at some given point in time.
- **Client** - Any actor that interacts with the *state* of an *instance* of 
  an *application*, whether to read or write it.

## Objective

We're using the term persistence in VWF to describe two different capabilities:

- **Instance Persistence** - Persist an instance of an application so that
  the instance is able to be accessed later with the same instance ID and
  state.

  For example, a client connects to an application instance `instance-x`, at
  point `A` and then disconnects at point `B`. At that point, the instance
  has no connected clients. A client then reconnects to the same instance at
  point `C`. The state should be maintained for `instance-x` and be available
  to the client.

```
instance-x  o---A---o---B...C---o---...
```

- **Save Instance State** - Save the state of any given instance of an
  application so that it's available later.

  For example, the application instance `instance-x` has it's state saved at
  point `A`, and later new instance `instance-y` is created with the save
  state `A` of `application-x`. 

```
instance-x  o---A---oâ€¦
                |
instance-y      o---o---o...
```

### Relationship Between Instance Persistence and Saving Instance State

As it turns out, once we add the capability to *save instance state*, we can have
the server save the state automatically when the last client disconnects. When
a client connects to the same instance ID, the server can load the last save
state when it bootstraps the environment. In other words, we'll accomplish
*instance persistence* by *saving instance state*.

This will require the server to maintain an *authoritative client* so
that the server always knows the correct state. For now, we will simply
ask the client for the state and trust that there is not tampering going
on.

## Socket Connection Versus Web Service

Within the context of a running instance of an application, there are
two different ways of interacting with the application instance.

**Socket Connection** - The socket connection is used to manipulate.
This is currently represented by function calls on `vwf_view` in client
code.

**Web Service** - The web service is used to communicate information
*about* an instance. This is currently supported by direct web service
calls from the client.

However, from the perspective of an application developer, we want to
*present a unified API* that does not force the developer to distinguish
between those two use cases. To that end, we will wrap the web service in
a VWF object with a namespace dedicated to communicating *about* the
instance. For example, `vwf_admin.someFunction()`.

To reiterate, the web service is *primarily for internal use.* Our goal
is to provide a javascript API to application developers.

## Application Developer Use Cases

### Instance Object Format

TODO: Make it happen

### State Object Format

TODO: Make it happen

### Save the state of an instance

**Motivation**

Application developer wants to save the state of the application instance
at a specific point in order to return to that "point in history" at some
time in the future.

**API**

From within a running application:

```
vwf_admin.saveState( {"name": "state-name"} ).then(
    function( stateName ) {
        // body of callback function to execute on success
    },
    function( error ) {
        // body of callback function to execute on error
    }
);
```

*Returns:* the name of the saved state if save is successful, and an error
otherwise.

*Notes:*

- If a save state with `"state-name"` already exists, it will be
  overwritten with the current state.

**Web Service**

`POST /path/to/app/{INSTANCE_NAME}/saves/`

*Arguments*

- *name (Optional)* - The name assigned to the save state, which will
  be used to retrieve the save state. If no name is specified, a name
  will be generated.

### List instances of an application

**Motivation**

Application developer wants to retrieve a list of the instances of an
application.

**API**

From within a running application:

```
vwf_admin.getInstances().then(
    function( instances ) {
        // body of callback function to execute on success
    },
    function( error ) {
        // body of callback function to execute on error
    }
);
```

*Returns:*

- Array of instance objects, with all metadata, including ID,
name, description, and a URL to connect to the instance.
- Empty array if there are no instances.

**Web Service**

`GET /path/to/app/instances`

*Returns:* An array of instance objects.

### List saved states for an application

**Motivation**

Application developer wants to retrieve a list of all saved states for all 
instances of an application.

**API**

From within a running application:

```
vwf_admin.application.getSaveStates().then(
    function( savedStates ) {
        // body of callback function to execute on success
    },
    function( error ) {
        // body of callback function to execute on error
    }
});
```

*Returns:* 

- Array of saved state objects, with all metadata, including ID, name, and a 
  URL to connect load the saved state.
- Empty array if there are no saved states.

**Web Service**

`GET /path/to/app/{INSTANCE_NAME}/saves/`

*Returns:* An array of saved state objects.

### List saved states for an instance

**Motivation**

Application developer wants to retrieve a list of the saved states for an
instance of an application.

**API**

From within a running application:

```
vwf_admin.getSaveStates().then(
    function( savedStates ) {
        // body of callback function to execute on success
    },
    function( error ) {
        // body of callback function to execute on error
    }
});
```

*Returns:* 

- Array of saved state objects, with all metadata, including ID, 
  name, and a URL to connect load the instance save state.
- Empty array if there are no saved states.

**Web Service**

`GET /path/to/app/{INSTANCE_NAME}/saves/`

*Returns:* An array of saved state objects.

### Load a specific instance with the latest save state

**Motivation**

Application developer wants to allow user to connect to an existing
instance, loading the latest save state in the process.

**Browser Interface**

Navigate to `/path/to/app/{INSTANCE_NAME}`.

*Note:* There is no web service or internal API for this.

*Note:* Changes will need to be made to the loading process to look for
save states for {INSTANCE_NAME} when bootstrapping the client.

### Load a specific save state as a new instance

**Motivation**

Application developer wants to allow user to load a specific save state
in a new instance.

**Browser Interface**

Navigate to `/path/to/app/{INSTANCE_NAME}/saves/{SAVE_NAME}`.

Browser will be redirected to `/path/to/app/{NEW_INSTANCE_NAME}` with the
save state loaded.

### Persist an instance

**Motivation**

Application developer wants to specify that instances should persist,
which means that the instance is available and the state maintained at the
current URL even when all clients disconnect.

Application developer will specify that instances for this application
will persist in the `index.vwf.config.yaml`.

### Set metadata for an instance

**TODO:** Move out of the design doc. This should not be part of the
persistence design doc as it is not required in order to support
persistence. It's just a nice to have.

**Motivation**

Application developer wants to set specific metadata for an application to
make it easier to identify the instance within a list.

**API**

From within a running application:

```
vwf_admin.updateMetadata( { ... } ).then(
    function( metadata ) {
        // body of callback function to execute on success
    },
    function( error ) {
        // body of callback function to execute on error
    }
);
```

*Returns:*

- Returns the instance's metadata upon success.

*Arguments*

An instance object with the name, description and whatever else set.

**Web Service**

`PUT /path/to/app/{INSTANCE_NAME}`

*Returns:* True or false?

*Arguments*

An instance object with the name, description and whatever else set.

#### Naming Instances

- No spaces, dots, or slashes to prevent clobbering resources served up by
  the application server.

## Saving and Restoring Instances and Time

- The timestamp should be saved along with the instance.
- Time should be restored to the saved value when the instance is
  loaded.

## Alternative Persistence Stores

Currently, using the filesystem, but should eventually be able to support
databases, etc. Should be configurable by application developer.
