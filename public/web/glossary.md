[A]:#A
---------------------
## A <a name='A' /> 

> ### Accessor

> A script that monitors, modifies, or intercepts property get or set operations.

> ### Action

> State change executed by the kernel.

> ### Application

## B <a name='B' />

> ### Behavior

> A fractional component that adds functionality to a component.

> ### Bubbling

## C <a name='C' />

> ### Capturing

> Means of gathering specific data

> ### Catalog

> A listing of applications and components.

> ### Child

> A node that is spawned by an existing node that is hierarchically higher.

> ### Client

> Connection to the reflector.du

> ### Component

> A piece of a VWF application, serving as a prototype, behavior, child, or the application itself. Components are stored collections of configured nodes.

> Property, method, event, or child of a node that an action is executed on.

> ### Method

> Incoming function call.

> ### Model

> Driver that executes within the shared state.

> ### Module

> The kernel (future), drivers, and supporting libraries (future) are JavaScript modules in loaded on demand. Modules are in the RequireJS format.

[N]:#N
---------------------
## N <a name='N' />

> ### Node

> The atomic unit of a VWF application. Nodes maintain state in properties, provide methods for incoming function calls, provide events for outgoing function calls, reference child nodes, and contain scripts to glue the pieces together.

> ### Parent

> A node that has knowledge of exactly one hierarchically higher node and multiple child nodes.

> ### Property

> Node state

> ### Prototype
