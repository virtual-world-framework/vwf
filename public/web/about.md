###WHAT![Virtual World Framework Compass](images/compass.png)

The Virtual World Framework (VWF) is a fast, light-weight, web-based architecture for creating and distributing secure, scalable, component-based, and collaborative virtual spaces. It leverages existing web-based standards, infrastructure, and emerging technologies with the intent of establishing a powerful yet simple to use platform that is built on top of the next generation of web browsers.

###WHY![Virtual World Framework](images/framework.png)

The VWF serves as a replicated computing platform for multi-user interactive 2D and 3D components with a high degree of customizability of the environment and high bandwidth communication between users. These are environments that are focused on work and working together – whether for training, collaboration and/or entertainment. 

VWF is a zero-install platform that can be extended dynamically in production. VWF spaces can be embedded anywhere HTML lives including websites and e-mail. Correspondingly, VWF can embed applications in any virtual space.
