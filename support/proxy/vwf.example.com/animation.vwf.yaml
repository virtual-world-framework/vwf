## `animation.vwf` adds standard animation functions to a node.
## 
## Animations play over a given `animationDuration` and at a given `animationRate` with respect to
## simulation time. `animationTime` tracks time as the animation plays. Setting `animationTime`
## moves the animation. The animation plays once to the end, or with `animationLoop` repeats
## indefinitely.
## 
## Events are sent to indicate `animationStarted`, `animationStopped` and `animationLooped`. Changes
## to the animation time are announced with `animationTimeChanged.`
##
## A node may provide an `animationUpdate` method to calculate its own animation state, or it may
## use a specialized behavior that implements a standard animation.
## 
## @name animation.vwf
## @namespace

# The duration must be a non-negative number, times are always in the range [ `0`, `duration` ], and
# the rate may be any number (although there is little protection against rates very near zero).
# 
#   0 <= animationDuration
#   0 <= animationTime <= animationDuration
#   -Infinity < animationRate < Infinity
# 
# The animation play state and time index are maintained in `animationStart$` and
# `animationPause$`. `animationPause$` is `null` while the animation is playing. The
# distance from `animationStart$` to the current time (when playing) or `animationPause$`
# (when paused) gives the time index, after accounting for the play rate.
# 
#   animationTime = ( ( animationPause$ || time ) - ( animationStart$ || time ) ) *
#     animationRate (positive rates)
#   animationTime = ( ( animationPause$ || time ) - ( animationStart$ || time ) ) *
#     animationRate + animationDuration (negative rates)
# 
#   animationPlaying = this.animationStart$ != null && this.animationPause$ == null
# 
# `animationStart$` and `animationPause$` are `null` before the animation is first played.
# This state is interpreted as `animationPlaying` == `false` and `animationTime` == `0`.
# 
#   animationStart$ == null => animationPause$ == null
#   animationStart$ == null => animationStop$ == null
# 
#   animationStart$ != null => animationStart$ <= time

# Properties named with a`$` suffix refer to times or durations on the simulation timeline. All
# other time-related properties refer to the animation timeline.
